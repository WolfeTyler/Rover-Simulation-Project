# Autonomous Mars Rover Simulation Project

The code currently is consistently capable of mapping >80% of the explorable environment with >80% map fidelity and usually within 300 seconds can locate and retrieve 3-5 rock samples. I am continuing to adjust the decision criteria and variables as the rover has a difficult time finding the final rock sample once it has retrieved most of the other samples and cleared much of the explorable map. It frequently revisits areas where there either was no rock sample present or where it has already removed the rock sample.

I have tested the Unity simulator environment with a 1024x768 screen resolution and good graphic quality as a point of reference.
